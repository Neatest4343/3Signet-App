Key Patterns and Relationships in the Data:
Correlation Patterns: The correlation matrix highlights strong relationships between variables. For instance, certain academic performance metrics like "Curricular units 1st sem (grade)" and "Curricular units 2nd sem (grade)" are strongly correlated. This suggests consistency in student performance across semesters.

Admission Grade and Graduation: Higher admission grades appear to have a positive relationship with graduation rates, suggesting that better-prepared students tend to perform well throughout their academic journey.

Tuition Fees and Performance: Students whose tuition fees are up to date tend to have better academic outcomes, as seen from higher approval rates in both the first and second semesters. This might indicate that financial stability contributes to student success.

Categorical Relationships: Categorical variables like "Mother's qualification" and "Father's qualification" seem to have subtle influences on student performance, though their impact is not as strong as numerical variables. Further investigation could be done to understand these patterns.

New Hypotheses Based on Exploratory Analysis:
Hypothesis 1: "Students with higher admission grades are more likely to graduate than students with lower admission grades." This can be tested using t-tests comparing the admission grades of graduates and dropouts.

Hypothesis 2: "There is a significant relationship between a studentâ€™s financial stability (tuition fees up to date) and their academic performance." This can be validated with chi-square tests between categorical academic outcomes and financial variables.

Hypothesis 3: "Students who consistently perform well across semesters (high grades in the first semester) are more likely to graduate." This hypothesis can be tested by analyzing correlations between first and second-semester grades and graduation rates
